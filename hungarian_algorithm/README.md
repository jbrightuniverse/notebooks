You may be interested in an alternate format of the algorithm:
- Faster Python version: https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/hungarianalg2
  - This resolves a bug with the original where decimals were not supported.
- Julia version: https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/HungarianAlg.jl
- C version: https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/FastHungarianAlgorithm
